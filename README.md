## Operators.
* Error Handling Operators.
  * retry()
    * be careful if the error repeats endlessly.
    
* cache()
  * be careful with memory.




## 
The key difference is that Observable pushes the items, while the streams and sequences pull the items.
This may seem subtle, but the impact of a push-based iteration is far more powerful than a pull-based one.
